## Introduction
This phase of the Business Event Management System project enhances the previous version by incorporating several key features:
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** A user-friendly interface has been implemented using Java Swing, providing a more intuitive way to interact with the system.
- **Exception Handling:** The system now includes robust exception handling to manage potential errors, including checked, unchecked, and a custom user-defined exception.
- **File Handling:** Functionality to save system data to a file and read data from a file has been added, allowing for data persistence.
- **Linked List Implementation:** One of the arrays used in Phase 1 has been replaced with a linked list to manage data more dynamically.

## Implementation Details

### GUI Implementation
The system now features a Graphical User Interface built with Java Swing. The GUI is designed with at least two main frames: one for user input and another for displaying results. Action events are handled to respond to user interactions with GUI components such as buttons and text fields.

### File Handling
The system implements file handling to save and load data. This allows the state of venues, events, tickets, sponsors, and visitors to be persisted between program executions.

### Exception Handling
Various types of exceptions are handled within the system to ensure graceful error management. This includes handling potential issues during file operations, user input validation, and other runtime scenarios. A user-defined exception has also been implemented to address specific application-level errors.

### Linked List Usage
One of the arrays from Phase 1 has been replaced with a linked list implementation. This change provides more flexibility in managing dynamic collections of objects within the system.
